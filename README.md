# AutoAnonsurf
I got bored and thought of ways to make an IP address rotate for extra anonimity(supposedly) so I decided to make a script to automate kali-anonsurf 

Requirements:
  Must have kali-anonsurf and python3 installed
  
 Usage: python autoanonsurf.py
 
 Side Note:
    if CTRL+C or CTRL+Z are pressed the script will stop and you will have to stop Anonsurf manually
